     * Returns the list of fields that should be returned by default by [[toArray()]] when no specific fields are specified.
     *
     * A field is a named element in the returned array by [[toArray()]].
     *
     * This method should return an array of field names or field definitions.
     * If the former, the field name will be treated as an object property name whose value will be used
     * as the field value. If the latter, the array key should be the field name while the array value should be
     * the corresponding field definition which can be either an object property name or a PHP callable
     * returning the corresponding field value. The signature of the callable should be:
     *
     * ```php
     * function ($model, $field) {
     *     // return field value
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * For example, the following code declares four fields:
     *
     * - `email`: the field name is the same as the property name `email`;
     * - `firstName` and `lastName`: the field names are `firstName` and `lastName`, and their
     *   values are obtained from the `first_name` and `last_name` properties;
     * - `fullName`: the field name is `fullName`. Its value is obtained by concatenating `first_name`
     *   and `last_name`.
     *
     * ```php
     * return [
     *     'email',
     *     'firstName' => 'first_name',
     *     'lastName' => 'last_name',
     *     'fullName' => function ($model) {
     *         return $model->first_name . ' ' . $model->last_name;
     *     },
     * ];
     * ```
     *
     * In this method, you may also want to return different lists of fields based on some context
     * information. For example, depending on [[scenario]] or the privilege of the current application user,
     * you may return different sets of visible fields or filter out some fields.
     *
     * The default implementation of this method returns [[attributes()]] indexed by the same attribute names.
     *
     * @return array the list of field names or field definitions.
     * @see toArray()
